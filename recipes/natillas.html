    <p>Natillas is a Spanish dessert made with milk, egg yolks, cornstarch, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and lemon peel. To make it, simmer the milk with cinnamon sticks and lemon peel, then whisk together egg yolks, cornstarch, and sugar. Slowly add the hot milk to the egg mixture, then cook over medium heat until it thickens. Remove the cinnamon sticks and lemon peel, transfer to serving dishes, and chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon before serving, if desired.</p>
