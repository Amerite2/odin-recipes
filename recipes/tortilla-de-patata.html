    <p>Tortilla de patata, also known as Spanish omelette or tortilla espa√±ola, is a simple and tasty dish made with potatoes, onions, eggs, and olive oil</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 medium-sized potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>4-5 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps to follow:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and thinly slice 2-3 medium-sized potatoes and 1/2 onion.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/2 cup of olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and onions to the pan and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they're soft but not browned.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 4-5 eggs and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and onions, then add them to the egg mixture and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over low-medium heat for 8-10 minutes, until the bottom is set but the top is still runny.</li>
        <li>Use a plate to flip the tortilla over, then slide it back into the pan to cook the other side for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide the tortilla onto a plate and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing into wedges.</li>
      </ol>
